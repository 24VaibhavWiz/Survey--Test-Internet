# Survey-Test-Java-Application-
In this project there there three parts.

The UML folder contains the UML diagram for the application using bridge pattern. I created the UML before I started coding. So, it is little different from the actual code but it is same for the most part. 

The folder name part 1 :

Creates, display, stores Survey/Test to a file as well as let the user modify a Survey/Test, take a Survey/Test, Tabulate and grade a Survey/test. 

The folder name part 2 : 

All the code remains same from part 1, the purpose of part 2 is to test the flexibility of the design with regard to I/O. Therefore, I changed the method of output for my survey/test generation program. I am using a library for a text to speech in java. The program display an entire survey/test with audio instead of the console. I am still using text for input as well as for all the menus.
